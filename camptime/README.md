## Camptime

A script to help notify you when a mob you are camping is expected to pop.

## Installation

You will need at least Python 3.0 and the playsound module installed in order to use this simple script.


* [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/)

To run, simply fire up your terminal/command line and type 

    python camptime.py

Alternatively, you can double click the file if you have a Python environment installed. The instructions are self-explanatory once you have launched the program.

You can either add mobs and their respawn times as you go, or edit the bestiary.txt file directly. Make sure you use an int for the respawn time, which is measured in seconds. Ex:

    {"an ice giant": 480, "Lord Begurgle": 1680}



Happy camping!
